# AI Prompt Generated Prototype

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Google Material UI](https://mui.com/). All files, UI, and functionality was generated by AI prompts, using a combination of [CodyAI](https://www.sourcegraph.com/cody), [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and [Cline](https://cline.bot/).

## Problem Statement
In today's data-driven world, understanding and visualizing complex datasets can be challenging for users without technical expertise.

 This prototype app leverages AI to simplify the process by providing an intuitive interface for visualizing and analyzing data through interactive graphs and charts. By utilizing AI-driven insights and recommendations, the app helps users better understand the data and make informed decisions by presenting it in a clear, accessible, and actionable format.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
